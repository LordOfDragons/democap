# Drag[en]gine Motion Capture

The DEMoCap Application allows to do Motion Capture using VR equipment. DEMoCap is build using the Drag[en]gine game engine. The resulting captured animations are usable directly in the Drag[en]gine game engine or can be imported into Blender for editing. Using Blender the captured animations can be used for all other purposes Blender can be used for.
