The Blender DEMoCap Tools Addon simplifies the process of importing motion capture animations created by [DEMoCap](https://dragondreams.ch/index.php/democap-dragengine-motion-capture). Both free captures as well as exported captures are supported.

See [Wiki Add-On Page](https://developer.dragondreams.ch/wiki/doku.php/democap:blender_democaptools) for informations on how to import motion capture created with DEMoCap as well as using tools like correction bones.

See [Wiki Live-Connection Page](https://developer.dragondreams.ch/wiki/doku.php/democap:blender_democaplive) for information on how to use live connection support to stream motion capture from DEMoCap directly into Blender without importing.

For importing captures installing the [Drag\[en\]gine Import/Export](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/dragengine-tools) extension is required. For using only Live Capture this is not required.
