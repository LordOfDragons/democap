The /develop directory contains development files not included in the game distribution.
These files are typically used for content used only for development purpose in the
DEIGDE editor or do to run-time game tests.

This directory is located under the data directory to include it into content management
systems and backup systems.

The generated distribution file excludes this directory from release builds.

This allows to keep pure development files alongside release files while developing
without pure development files ending up in releases.

You can rename or move this directory if you want to. When you do this remember to update
the distribution profiles in the Distributor Editor to properly exclude the directory.
